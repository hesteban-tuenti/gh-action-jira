  Scenario: User accesses to the account tab and an API error occurs: API error screen is displayed
    internal_checkpoint="Note that here API error means that the API fa√áade that returns the account information must
    fail. This might be tested by asking that the thirdPartyClients/4p/url points to an invalid URL and waiting some
    minutes, but not for Colombia Home lines. Home lines do not require enough 4p information to get into the 'general
    failure'.
    Carlos Fernandez from account team proposes to configure hystrix circuits between account and NOVUM services to be
    open. We might explore this option"
